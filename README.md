product requirements
The goal is to design and develop a calm, intelligent website to help users understand, manage, and mitigate "dopamine bursts" from overstimulation, fostering sustained focus and well-being. The website should be a digital sanctuary with a soothing, minimalist, and distraction-free design.

Key features include:

Understanding Dopamine & Brain Health: Educational resources (articles, infographics, videos) and self-assessment quizzes to identify triggers and digital habits.
Dopamine Regulation Tools & Exercises: "Dopamine Detox" guide, "Focus Zones" / "Deep Work Timer" (Pomodoro), Mindfulness & Breathing Exercises, Digital Detox Prompts, and "Mindful Consumption" prompts.
Goal Setting & Progress Tracking: Micro-goal setter, visual progress tracking, and a private journaling feature.
Personalization & Customization: Personalized content recommendations and customizable environment options (colors, sounds).
Community & Support (Optional): Anonymous forum, Q&A, expert insights.
Design principles emphasize ultra-clean, minimalist UI with calm color palettes, intuitive navigation, responsive design, subtle animations, and accessibility. The site must reduce digital dependency, ensure user privacy, and maintain an empathetic tone.

key technical concepts
Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components, React Context API (for state management), Axios (for API calls), Local Storage (for persisting mock data).
Backend (Initial): FastAPI, MongoDB (via motor client), python-dotenv for environment variables, uuid for IDs, datetime for timestamps, CORSMiddleware.
Overall Architecture: Full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.
code architecture
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend directories.

Key Files and Their Importance:

/app/frontend/package.json: Manages frontend dependencies, scripts, and browser compatibility. Contains core React, Radix UI (shadcn/ui base), Tailwind CSS, and utility libraries.
/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js: Configures Tailwind CSS, including custom colors, spacing, and animations based on Shadcn/ui's design system, ensuring consistent styling.
/app/frontend/src/index.css: Imports Tailwind's base, components, and utilities. Defines global CSS variables for light/dark mode theming, derived from Tailwind's color palette.
/app/frontend/src/App.css: Contains basic React app styling, including the logo animation.
/app/frontend/src/App.js: The main React application entry point. Configures React Router DOM for client-side routing. Initialized with a basic / route fetching a "Hello World" message from the backend.
Changes Made: This file now houses the BrowserRouter and Routes to manage navigation between the new pages. The Home component serves as the landing page.
/app/frontend/src/hooks/use-toast.js: Provides a custom React hook for managing toast notifications, built on top of Radix UI's toast primitives.
/app/backend/requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend, including FastAPI, Uvicorn, Motor (MongoDB driver), Pydantic, and python-dotenv.
/app/backend/server.py: The FastAPI backend application. Sets up CORS middleware, connects to MongoDB, and defines initial API routes (/api/, /api/status). It includes Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB operations.
Changes Made: This file was initially provided and acts as the foundational backend structure. No modifications were explicitly stated or made to this file within the provided trajectory.
/app/frontend/src/data/mockData.js (New): Crucial for the initial frontend-only implementation. Contains comprehensive mock data for educational content, tools, goals, journal entries, and assessment questions.
/app/frontend/src/contexts/UserContext.js (New): Implements React Context API for global state management. This likely handles user-specific data like assessment results, goals, and journal entries in the mock phase.
/app/frontend/src/components/Navigation.js (New): Contains the main navigation components, ensuring intuitive flow across the application's sections as per design requirements.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.js (New): The landing page, designed with a hero section, feature cards, benefits overview, and a call-to-action for the assessment.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Education.js (New): Displays educational articles about dopamine, digital wellness, and focus, with search, filter, and modal functionality.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Tools.js (New): Houses interactive tools like the Focus Timer, Meditation Exercises, Digital Detox Challenges, and Ambient Sounds.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Goals.js (New): Allows users to create, edit, and track personal wellness goals with visual progress indicators.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Progress.js (Implied New): Visualizes user progress, including focus time, screen time trends, wellness scores, and achievement badges.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Journal.js (Implied New): Provides a private journaling interface with mood tracking and trigger identification.
/app/frontend/src/pages/Assessment.js (Implied New): Contains the comprehensive questionnaire for digital habits and generates personalized recommendations.
The UI components from /app/frontend/src/components/ui/ (e.g., button.jsx, card.jsx, dialog.jsx, input.jsx, select.jsx, slider.jsx, switch.jsx, tabs.jsx, textarea.jsx) are extensively used to build the application's user interface, ensuring consistency and adherence to Shadcn/ui design principles.

pending tasks
Backend development: Replace mock data with a real MongoDB database and integrate the frontend with FastAPI endpoints for all features (Education, Tools, Goals, Progress, Journal, Assessment).
Frontend design adjustments: Implement any requested design changes or functionality tweaks to the existing frontend.
current work
Currently, a comprehensive frontend-only implementation of the "Dopamine Regulation & Digital Wellness" website has been completed and is fully functional with mock data. This provides a complete "aha moment" experience for the user.

Key aspects of the current implementation include:

Navigation: All main sections (Home, Education, Tools, Goals, Progress, Journal, Assessment) are navigable.
Interactive Features:
Users can take the Assessment and receive personalized results based on mock data.
Goals can be created, edited, and deleted, with progress visually tracked (using local storage).
Journal entries can be written and managed (using local storage).
Focus Timers (Pomodoro, deep work, etc.) and Meditation Tools (guided breathing, body scans) are interactive and functional.
Education content is searchable, filterable, and viewable in modal dialogs.
Progress Charts and achievement badges display mock data trends.
Design: The site features a calm, soothing, minimalist UI with muted colors, dark/light mode support, responsive layouts, subtle animations, and accessibility considerations.
Technical Stack: Built with React, leveraging React Context for state management and local storage for persisting mock user data. Shadcn/ui components are utilized for UI elements.
The previous AI engineer has built out a robust prototype that demonstrates the complete user journey and core functionalities of the application, all powered by simulated data.

optional next step
Proceed with backend development to replace the mock data with a real MongoDB database and integrate it with the frontend.
